## üöÄ Getting Started for Developers

Follow these instructions to set up your own local development environment, including a fresh Appwrite Cloud backend. This allows you to develop and test features in isolation without affecting a production database.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](httpss://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control
-   An [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) account (the free tier is more than sufficient).

### Development Setup: Step-by-Step

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/the-repo-name.git
cd the-repo-name
```

#### Step 2: Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Your Appwrite Cloud Project

This is the most critical step. You will create your own backend on Appwrite that mirrors the required structure of the application.

1.  **Create a New Project**
    -   Log in to your [Appwrite Cloud account](https://cloud.appwrite.io).
    -   Click **Create Project** and give it a name (e.g., `specs-dev-yourname`).

2.  **Add a Web Platform**
    -   Inside your new project, navigate to the **Platforms** section from the left menu.
    -   Click **Add Platform** and choose **New Web App**.
    -   Give it a name (e.g., "Local Dev").
    -   For the **Hostname**, enter `localhost`. This is crucial for local development.

3.  **Create the Database and Collections**
    -   Navigate to the **Databases** section.
    -   Click **Create Database** and name it `Main Database`.
    -   **Inside this database, create the following collections one by one.** You must use the exact **Attribute Keys** and **Types** for the code to work correctly.

    <summary><strong>üìã Click to view required Collection schemas</strong></summary>

    ---
    **1. Collection: `students`**
    - **Purpose:** Stores user profile data.
    - **Permissions:** For `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`, grant the `users` role.
    - **Attributes:**
      | Key | Type | Required | Default |
      | :-- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
      | `username` | String | ‚úÖ | |
      | `fullname` | String | ‚úÖ | |

      | `gender` | String | ‚úÖ | |
      | `type` | String | ‚úÖ | `student` |
      | `verified` | Boolean | ‚úÖ | `false` |
      | `haveResume`| Boolean| ‚úÖ | `false` |
      | `resumeId` | String | | |
      | `haveSchedule`|Boolean| ‚úÖ | `false` |
      | `scheduleId`| String | | |
      | `email` | String | ‚úÖ | |

    ---
    **2. Collection: `events`**
    - **Purpose:** Stores event information.
    - **Permissions:** Grant `users` the `Create` role. For `Read`, grant `any`.
    - **Attributes:**
      | Key | Type | Required |
      | :-- | :--- | :---: |
      | `event_name` | String | ‚úÖ |
      | `date_to_held`| Datetime | ‚úÖ |
      | `image_file` | String | ‚úÖ |
      | `description`| String | |
      | `added_by` | String | ‚úÖ |
    - **Indexes:** Create a **full-text** index on the `event_name` and `description` attributes.

    ---
    **3. Collection: `files`**
    - **Purpose:** Stores metadata for shared files.
    - **Permissions:** Grant `users` the `Create` and `Read` roles.
    - **Attributes:**
      | Key | Type | Required |
      | :-- | :--- | :---: |
      | `fileName` | String | ‚úÖ |
      | `description`| String | |
      | `uploader` | String | ‚úÖ |
      | `fileID` | String | ‚úÖ |
    - **Indexes:** Create a **full-text** index on the `fileName` and `description` attributes.

    ---
    **4. Collection: `revenue` & `expenses`**
    - **Purpose:** Financial tracking. For a secure setup, use role-based permissions (see note below).
    - **Attributes for `revenue`:**
      | Key | Type | Required | Default |
      | :-- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
      | `name` | String | ‚úÖ | |
      | `price` | Double | ‚úÖ | |
      | `quantity` | Integer | ‚úÖ | |
      | `date_earned`| Datetime | ‚úÖ | |
      | `recorder` | String | ‚úÖ | |
      | `isEvent` | Boolean | ‚úÖ | `false` |
      | `event` | String | | |
      | `activity` | String | | |
    - **Attributes for `expenses`:**
      | Key | Type | Required | Default |
      | :-- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
      | `name` | String | ‚úÖ | |
      | `price` | Double | ‚úÖ | |
      | `quantity` | Integer | ‚úÖ | |
      | `date_buy` | Datetime | ‚úÖ | |
      | `recorder` | String | ‚úÖ | |
      | `isEvent` | Boolean | ‚úÖ | `false` |
      | `event` | String | | |
      | `activity_name` | String | | |
      
    > **Note on Finance Permissions:** For production, it is highly recommended to use **Team-based permissions** for the `revenue` and `expenses` collections. Create a team (e.g., `finance-officers`), add authorized users, and grant `Read/Write` permissions to that team ID instead of a general role.

    </details>

4.  **Create Storage Buckets**
    -   Navigate to the **Storage** section.
    -   Click **Create Bucket** for each of the following, enabling **File-Level Permissions** for all of them.
        -   `Event Images`
        -   `User Uploads`
        -   `Resumes`
        -   `Schedules`

#### Step 4: Configure Your Local Environment

Connect your local frontend to the Appwrite backend you just created.

1.  Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
2.  Copy and paste the template below into this new file.
3.  **Fill in every `<...>` placeholder with the actual IDs from your Appwrite project.** You can find these in your Appwrite project's Settings, Database, and Storage pages.

    ```ini
    # .env.local - Fill this with your own project IDs

    # Get from your Appwrite Project Settings
    VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
    VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="<YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_ID>"

    # Get from your "Main Database" settings page
    VITE_DATABASE_ID="<YOUR_NEW_DATABASE_ID>"

    # Get from the settings page of each collection you created
    VITE_COLLECTION_ID_STUDENTS="<YOUR_STUDENTS_COLLECTION_ID>"
    VITE_COLLECTION_ID_EVENTS="<YOUR_EVENTS_COLLECTION_ID>"
    VITE_COLLECTION_ID_FILES="<YOUR_FILES_COLLECTION_ID>"
    VITE_COLLECTION_ID_REVENUE="<YOUR_REVENUE_COLLECTION_ID>"
    VITE_COLLECTION_ID_EXPENSES="<YOUR_EXPENSES_COLLECTION_ID>"

    # Get from the settings page of each bucket you created
    VITE_BUCKET_ID_EVENT_IMAGES="<YOUR_EVENT_IMAGES_BUCKET_ID>"
    VITE_BUCKET_ID_UPLOADS="<YOUR_UPLOADS_BUCKET_ID>"
    VITE_BUCKET_ID_RESUMES="<YOUR_RESUMES_BUCKET_ID>"
    VITE_BUCKET_ID_SCHEDULES="<YOUR_SCHEDULES_BUCKET_ID>"
    ```

    > **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The `.env.local` file is ignored by Git, so your secret keys will not be committed.

#### Step 5: Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or similar), fully connected to your personal Appwrite Cloud backend. You can now create your own `student` and `admin` accounts to test all features.
