## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](httpss://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Fork the Repository**
    First, create a fork of the main project repository on GitHub. This gives you your own copy to work with.

2.  **Clone Your Fork**
    Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-repo-name.git
    ```

3.  **Navigate to Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd the-repo-name
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all the required npm packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    This is the most important step for connecting to the Appwrite Cloud project.

    - Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project directory.
    - Copy the contents of `.env.example` (or the template below) into your new `.env.local` file.

    ```ini
    # .env.local

    # Do NOT commit this file to Git.

    VITE_BUCKET_ID_UPLOADS="<UPLOADS_BUCKET_ID_FROM_ADMIN>"
    VITE_BUCKET_ID_RESUMES="<RESUMES_BUCKET_ID_FROM_ADMIN>"
    VITE_BUCKET_ID_SCHEDULES="<SCHEDULES_BUCKET_ID_FROM_ADMIN>"
    ```
    > **Security Note:** You **must** request the actual values for the placeholders from the project administrator. These are secrets and should never be hardcoded or committed to the repository.

6.  **Run the Development Server**
    Start the Vite development server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

7.  **Open the App**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in your terminal). The application should now be running locally and connected to the shared Appwrite Cloud backend.
